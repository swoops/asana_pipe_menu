# asana_pipe_menu
Makes an openbox pipemenu for asana tasks.

This is not complete by any means but does what I want it to do (mostly)
so I  am happy with it.

# Make it work
Download the .py file then change the first two variables to fit your asana needs.

Running asana_pipe.py -m may help with the "workspaces" variable.

# Warning
Your access_tokens are as good as credentials.  These are stored in plain text
inside of this file.  Anyone with access to your computer can steal them.  I may
add a keyring or something tricky in the future but for now this is how it is.
